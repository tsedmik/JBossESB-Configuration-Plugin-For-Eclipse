service=E\#R1N\#Service\#A service has listener or gateways and a list of actions
service/category=A\#String255\#R\#\#\#Category\#The service category which will be used to store a reference to this service in the registry.
service/name=A\#String255\#R\#\#\#Name\#The service name which will be used to store a reference to this service in the registry.
service/description=A\#String255\#R\#\#\#Description\#The service description which stored with this service in the registry, so that the purpose of this service can be understood by a human.
service/alertTimeThreshold=A\#Decimal\#O\#\#\#Alert Time Threshold\#A value used for monitoring to produce alerts if the service takes longer to complete than the value of the field.
service/alertLengthThreshold=A\#Decimal\#O\#\#\#Alert Length Threshold\#A value used for monitoring to produce alerts if the service takes longer to complete than the value of the field.
service/invmScope=A\#String\#O\#NONE,GLOBAL\#\#invmScope\#All services are locally invokable over an "in VM" transport. Invokability can be scoped using this attribute.  An "invmScope" value of "NONE" means that the Service should not be locally invokable over the "in VM" transport. More fine grained scoping will be added in the future.
